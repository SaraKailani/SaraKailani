- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sara and I'm from Portugal.

- Most people dream of flying, and I couldn't be different. I've always had this passion since I was a little girl, and one day I managed to make that dream come true. Fearless && headstrong, I gave it all in the Air Force and as a reward, I had the best experience of my life flying awesome warplanes !
 
- With that dream checked, I left my passion for computers on stand-by. The loops && ifâ€™s of life took me on opposite paths, where I came to build mad social and empathic skillz in a psychiatric ward working as a Social Worker.

- Though rewarding && challenging, stubborn me decided to embark on another kind of madness, and dove headfirst into an insanely demanding bootcamp @ <Academia de CÃ³digo_>, where the old passion for computers grew to a whole other level !

- Strengthened by the infinite power of Java, I shall now continue on my never ending quest
for greater challenges to conquer new programming languages.
